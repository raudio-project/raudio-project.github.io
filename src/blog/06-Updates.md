## Multiple Songs, Skip
We now have functionality for our server to stream multiple audio files, one after another. Now, your Raudio server, with enough provided audio files,
can act as an actual radio station. Also, in addition to `PAUSE` and `PLAY` commands for authenticated users, we have also added a `SKIP` function that
switches the currently streaming audio track to a new, randomly selected track from the available audio files. We have also implemented this functionality
into our example bot. 

## Packaging
We are in the process of making Raudio available in PyPI. We did minor organization to our project and moved code files to a `src` directory. We also 
finalized our `.gitignore` and added a `pyproject.toml` file, and a configuration file to ensure that we complete all requirements to package Raudio.

## Public
We are still in the process of announcing Raudio and are nearly ready to do so on multiple sites to get public attention. We also are working on making
our final Raudio presentation showcasing the final results of our project and its delivery to the public. We are also making a video that will demonstrate
basic functionality of Raudio that will act as both a showcase and instructional video on how to use this software. In addition, we have created some
simple issues for Raudio that can be found [here](https://github.com/raudio-project/raudio-project.github.io/issues), for the spirit of an open source
project, the requirements for our Open Source Software Development Course, and for prospective contributors (who will likely soon be some undergraduate
students).
