## Code of Conduct, Contributions
We [added](https://github.com/raudio-project/raudio-server/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) a Contributor Convenant code of conduct to our repository. We also added a 
[Contributing](https://github.com/raudio-project/raudio-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document which gives some resources to learn about the frameworks used in
the project, as well as areas and guidelines for starting a contribution to Raudio.

## Wiki
We created a [wiki](https://github.com/raudio-project/raudio-server/wiki) for Raudio. It currently features a short guide to run the server on localhost and stream
one OPUS audio file for clients to listen to, and a list of dependencies to get the project running. As the project matures, as will the wiki fill with more content.
We are planning on soon adding a demo video for more clarity. As we add more capability to our server and a library for users to create their own clients, we will
add sufficient documentation covering that to our wiki, too.

## Announcement
Soon, we will be making a public announcement for Raudio for both the purpose of getting public exposure to build our community and as a part of our milestone.
We plan to add Raudio to PyPI so that it has easier deployment, and so more people may be willing to check out the software that way. As for where to make the
announcement, we have plans to make it official on our website (this one) and post to several forums, potentially (but not limited to) [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/),
[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/), [Tildes](https://tildes.net/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/). Stay tuned!
